I made such a simple, small Command Line Interface project with an API. So tiny. And there is so much I could expand on the project, that I can see. But, to be honest, I am so proud of myself. No, I am not an expert now on Ruby or APIs or CLIs or Object Orientation. But I have the capabalities to make it all work. With patience, Google, lots and lots of coffee, and breaks, I used everything I have learned in Flatiron and created my first program. 

After reading the instructions, I wrote down: ask user to enter infromation, fetch remote information and print it out for the user. Super simple, right? NOT! 

My first step was to look for a public and free API that was simple to use and seemed interesting. Through guiadance, I looked and found the perfect API on a Github list of public APIs. This was probably the easiest step of the entire project. 

Then the little and annoying stuff happened. I could not open the Sandbox that was provided, so I started looking into using a local environment. I successfully created a local environment on my PC. Yay! But I still had not started my project. I created a project file. Tried to install the gems for it, and my PC dies. Great! I did end up finding a reliable laptop. Created a new local environment. And I moved forward. Created the basics, created all the classes, a lot of puts statements, a while loop, if/else statements. Then came the challenge. Sorta... I created the API file. Successfully was receiving the correct information. Was able to create objects and give it attibutes like name, nickname and status. With the names I was able to create a list. The tricky part was when I tried fetching the quote for the correct character, which was the entire point of the project in the first place. Panic mode!!! The next step was to create a different class method to get quotes, different from the class method that gathers the characters. 

I was able to complete the project as is. YAY! Could I have expanded on it? Of course, yes. But the point is I understood the basics and was able to prove I can build my own program.
