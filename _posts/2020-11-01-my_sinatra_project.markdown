## What a week!!!!

### I have learned a lot these last few weeks. This module was giving headaches from time to time, but I had a lot of fun creating my very first web application. (YAY)
### The stress comes from having to be extremely detail oriented. And very organized. It is so easy to get lost in the "routes", "redirects" and "rendering the correct view". If it wasn't the "redirecting to the wrong route" problem, it was the "mispelling words" probelm. Sometimes both issues happened at once, and sometimes in multiple files. But I made it through.  And on to the next module we go..
