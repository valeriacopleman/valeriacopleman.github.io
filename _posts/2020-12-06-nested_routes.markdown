Creating nested routes was very tricky. I simply could not wrap my head around the logic of creating them. All I kept thinking of was, 'I can do that without nested routes'. But it's done. I really wish there was more time or more labs on this topic, but maybe it is just me. 

I began the Rails Project with creating the user sign in, log in, and log out capabilities. The Oauth sign in with Github was very easy to create, I hink there our cohort leader prepared us very well for it as well. Don't get me wrong, it was still a bumpy ride, but it was more managable versus nested routes, in my opinion. 

The thing about nested routes is, you need to add in arguments to your routes, sometimes the route would not catch the proper arguments, then you also have to take into consideration what exactly you are trying to show after you click each button. Sometimes there was not really the option to simply click the back button. The routes got messy at one point, but I made it through.
