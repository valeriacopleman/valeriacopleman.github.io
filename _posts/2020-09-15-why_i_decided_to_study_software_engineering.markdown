There was a time in my life, like everyone else, where I was not sure what I wanted to do career-wise. I had been in customer service for 5 years and in pharmacy for 4 years. I was smoked-checked at the pharmacy and began searching for careers that were more "in the background", somewhere I can use my skills to still help people but not be in the front lines. Through my search, I found and tried a free online course and enjoyed it. I believe this is where I am supposed to be. If I can help one company create something to better the lives of others, I want to be a part of it. Technology is evolving fast and I want to offer my services the best I can.
